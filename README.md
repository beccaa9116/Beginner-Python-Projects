# Beginner-Python-Projects
a few beginner to intermediate projects I have done to get more comfortable with Python programming

1. Madlibs - a very basic practice of using inputs and strings
2. Calculator - fun fact: ever since I started programming, the first thing I try to do in any programming language is a calculator, and Python cannot be an exception, let's gooo
3. Rock, paper, scissors game - with a bit of a loop practice so the game can go on and on
4. Snake game - most of the code and inspiration goes to Geeksforgeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-snake-game-using-turtle-in-python/
5. Currency converter - a very simple one, not a realtime one, for practice of using multiple inputs, loops and combinations :)
6. Minesweeper game
7. Solving sudoku using Python program
8. Generating QR code for URL from user input - the QR code is automatically saved as an image
9. Math Challenge generator that will generate 10 math problems and measure your solving time
10. Digital Clock
11. Alarm Clock - a timer that will count down time based on user input and play a sound when the time is up :)
12. A very simple dice roll simulator - a code generating two random numbers from 1 to 6 to simulate rolling of dice
13. Password generator
