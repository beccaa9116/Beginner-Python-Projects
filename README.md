# Beginner-Python-Projects
a few projects I used to get more comfortable with Python programming

1. Madlibs - a very basic practice of using inputs and strings
2. Calculator - fun fact: ever since I started programming, the first thing I try to do in any programming language is a calculator, and Python cannot be an exception, let's gooo
3. Rock, paper, scissors game - with a bit of a loop practice so the game can go on and on
4. Snake game - most of the code and inspiration goes to Geeksforgeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-snake-game-using-turtle-in-python/
